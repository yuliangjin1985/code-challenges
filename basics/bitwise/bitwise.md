# Bitwise operations

## Two's Complement Representation

In two's complement representation, negative integers are represented by taking the bitwise complement of the positive integer (flipping all the bits) and then adding 1 to the result. This representation ensures that the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) represents the sign of the number (0 for positive and 1 for negative).
