# When to Use Backtracking

**Combinatorial Problems**: Backtracking is ideal for problems where you need to explore all possible combinations or permutations of a set of items. Examples include generating all possible subsets, permutations, or arrangements of a set of elements.

**Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: In problems where you need to find solutions that meet certain constraints (like puzzle solving, e.g., Sudoku, or N-Queens problem), backtracking can systematically explore potential solutions and backtrack when a constraint is violated.

**Decision Trees & Searching**: Problems that naturally form a decision tree (like game trees in chess or other strategy games) often use backtracking. The algorithm explores different branches (moves or decisions) and backtracks upon reaching a dead end or an undesirable outcome.

**Pathfinding in Graphs**: In graph-related problems where you need to find paths (like mazes) or certain structures (like Hamiltonian cycles), backtracking helps in exploring different paths and backtracking when a path leads to a dead end or doesn't fulfill the criteria.

**Mutable vs Immutable Structures**
Mutable Structures (e.g., Lists in Python): When using mutable structures, backtracking typically involves modifying the structure (like adding or removing elements) as you delve deeper into the solution space. After exploring a branch, you revert the changes (backtrack) to explore other branches. This is seen in problems where you build a temporary solution incrementally.

Immutable Structures (e.g., Strings or Tuples in Python): With immutable structures, each modification creates a new instance. In backtracking, you pass these modified instances down the recursive calls. Backtracking in this context doesn't require explicit reversion of state; instead, you just stop passing the current modified instance further. It's more about exploring different branches by creating different modified instances based on the current state.

**Summary**
Backtracking is a versatile approach used in various types of problems, especially where exploration of multiple possibilities is essential. The choice to use backtracking is more about the problem's requirements and less about whether the data involved is mutable or immutable. In mutable structures, backtracking involves explicit modification and reversion of the structure, while in immutable structures, it involves creating and exploring different modified instances.
