# Dynamic Programming

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Calculating the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Shortest Path Problems (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm)**: Finding the shortest path in a graph from one node to another.
3. **Knapsack Problem**: Determining the most valuable combination of items to carry given weight constraints.
4. **Coin Change Problem**: Finding the minimum number of coins or the number of ways to make up a certain amount of money with given coin denominations.
5. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Identifying the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
6. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Finding the length of the longest subsequence in a sequence where all elements are in increasing order.
7. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Determining the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices.
8. **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)**: Calculating the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.
9. **Maximum Subarray Problem**: Identifying the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.
10. **Travelling Salesman Problem**: Finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the origin city.
11. **Cutting a Rod**: Optimizing the cutting of a rod to maximize profit based on prices of different lengths.
12. **Egg Dropping Puzzle**: Determining the minimum number of trials needed to find the critical floor in a building from which an egg breaks when dropped.
13. **Combination and Permutation**: Coin change 2, the number of combinations that make up that amount.
